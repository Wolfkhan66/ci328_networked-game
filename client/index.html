      <p>
        <strong>Frog:</strong> your aim is to collect as many coins as possible, whilst avoiding being captured by the ghosts.<br />
        <strong>Ghosts:</strong> your mission is to catch the frog, you will then become a frog and have the chance to collect as many coins as you can before being caught. <br />
        Either character can collect the mystery powerups - they might double your speed and points or they could be halved, the risk is yours!
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the directional buttons to move, collect as many points as you can before time runs out.
